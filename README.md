# About
My personal dotfiles. A lot of things were adopted from people like
[@holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles),
[@mathiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles), and others
listed on [dotfiles.github.io](https://dotfiles.github.io).


# Usage
The dotfiles are managed using [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).
Run `./install` from the project root to set things up.
