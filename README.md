# About
My personal dotfiles. A lot of things were adopted from people like
[@holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles),
[@mathiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles), and others
listed on [dotfiles.github.io](https://dotfiles.github.io).


# Usage
Everything is very much in beta and the automated installation via the
``bootstrap`` script is probably going to fail.

# TODO

- [ ] Improve readme.
